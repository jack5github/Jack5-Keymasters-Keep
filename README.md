# Jack5's Keymaster's Keep

This repository contains Jack5's keep and trial definitions of various games, made for [Keymaster's Keep](https://github.com/SerpentAI/Archipelago/releases?q=keymaster%27s+keep) (an [Archipelago Multiworld Randomiser](https://archipelago.gg/) game).

## Installation

1. [Install Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en).
2. Add the [Keymaster's Keep `.apworld` file](https://github.com/SerpentAI/Archipelago/releases?q=keymaster%27s+keep) into Archipelago's `worlds/` folder.
3. Run the Archipelago Launcher. A new `keymasters_keep/` folder will be created.
4. Download the `.py` files in [this repository's `keymasters_keep/` folder](https://github.com/jack5github/Jack5-Keymasters-Keep/tree/main/keymasters_keep) for the games you wish to add to the game pool, and place them into the `keymasters_keep/` folder.
5. Restart the Archipelago Launcher and open 'Generate Template Options'. The `Players/Templates/Keymaster's Keep.yaml` file will now contain the customisable settings for each Keymaster's Keep implementation installed.
